            <h1>Giant Strawberry Shortcake</h1>
            <p>his easy strawberry shortcake takes a major shortcut: Rather than cutting out biscuits and plating each individual shortcake, you press the stir-together dough into a square pan and bake it as one big slab. Made with melted butter, heavy cream, and sour cream, the biscuit is wonderfully tender (plus, theres no need to cut in cold butter). Spoon juicy macerated berries over the top of the big shortcake so the juices soak in, then finish with a sour cream whip and more juicy fruit. Whats summer if not messy and joyful?.</p>
